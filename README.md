# CurfewBot: The Solution to Vhronic Late Night Gamers
## What is it?
This is exactly what it sounds like. It's a Discord bot that forces a curfew on members in your Discord group.
The bot removes a user from any (and every) voice channel at a specified time and will not allow them to rejoin until their curfew is up.

### HOW to use?
Command to set a curfew:
  - !curfew [time][AM/PM] [username]
